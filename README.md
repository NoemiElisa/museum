Museum: TESTING IN VIRTUAL REALITY (VR)

This project is a VR game created with Unity as part of the experience of the VR Developer Nanodegree at Udacity. It is targeted for android, but could be deployed for IOS as well.

Summary: Many efforts are put nowadays in teaching how to develop to several levels, starting with kids. I think teaching how to test is also important and it could be done via a VR platform.

Museum:
Since we needed the system to look like a museum, I thought for testing it would be fun to make it look like the first computers.
I used the appartment course starter for the room and the exterior. I added some prefax from it.
The computers were downloaded from: http://www.esi.uclm.es/museo/
I added a few canvas around the room to explain the different types of testing and some moths above the computers.
I used waypoints to move around the room because I did not want to make it too complicated to find the moths. There are extra waypoints and you should be able to find at least one moth per waypoint.

Statement of purpose: The purpose of the project is to learn different type of testing and how to apply them in VR applications.

Persona: 
Name: Little billy.
Age: 12.
Occupation: Student.
Quote “I love games and I would like to learn how to create them”.
Motive: Students like Billy like games and want to learn how to create them. Testing is part of creating the games, if the environment is motivational and game/like, Billy is interested.
VR experience: Little.



Breakdown of final app: At the start of the experience there is a UI screen introducing the application and the environment to the users. Then the user can move by clicking the spheres (waypoints) around the room. The goal of the application is to find all the moths and learn about testing with each one of them.


Decisions on the application:
The application should be free, as students don’t usually have a lot of budget. The application should run in as many environments as possible…
The application should be interactive. Originally, I was thinking in interactive testing, but, since this project is meant to be a museum, I ended up creating an environment to teach them what is testing and how to apply it to VR.
The application does not need to be too realistic, with a simple game it would be enough.
The student should feel participant, but being passive for a lesson or solution of the current challenge would be allowed.

Next steps:

    Test with users.
    Add more moths.
    Add a way of practicing each of the testing types by clicking on each moths (mini-games)
